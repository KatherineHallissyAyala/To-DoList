# To-DoList
This react app displays an initial to-do list, provides a form where the user can add tasks to the list, and includes a Delete button with each task.
# How to Run
Open the HTML file in a browser.  Make sure all filesare stored in the same directory as the HTML file.  In the terminal, navigate to the files' directory, and run http-server in that directory.  The output in the terminal should indicate the local server url where you can view the index.html file.
# Usage
When the page loads, the user will see a text entry form a to-do list consisting of three items, and an "x" button next to each task.  Use the text form to enter additional tasks you'd like to see on the list.  When you submit a task, you should see it appear at the bottom of the list.  If you click on one of the "x" buttons, that should delete the task associated with that "x" button from the list.

# Roadmap for future improvements
I worked on this project in a Fullstack Developer certification course.  I could envision improving upon the project by adding a "priority" field to the form.  The list could then be sorted according to priority.
